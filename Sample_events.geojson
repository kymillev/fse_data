vaccination method was established and used by all people 本年新設種痘之法使世人種之 Since ancient times, the method of blowing dried smallpox scabs up the nose was used in all cases against contagion with smallpox. Coming the year 1851, Uku Pēchin Kijin 宇久親雲上紀仁 of the Matsu-clan 松氏 [i.e. Nakachi Kijin] practiced a new smallpox vaccination method. He made rounds in the villages such as Tomari, Naha, and the Chinese encampment [= Kume] and inoculated small children with this method. Compared to blowing dried smallpox scabs up the nose, with this new method there were extremely less pustules. Later this method of blowing dried smallpox scabs up the nose was abandoned. 自古以來，傳染痘瘡，皆用以痂吹鼻之法。上屆亥年，松氏宇久親雲上紀仁曾習種痘之法，巡行泊、那霸、唐榮等村，用其法于小児，比吹鼻之法出痘甚少。後難以痂吹鼻並無再出。  Moreover, more recently it was heard that in the previous year in Japan a smallpox vaccination method was used, and that all little children were in good health. Tokashiki Pēchin Tsūki 渡嘉敷親雲上通起 of the Ro-clan 呂氏 [i.e. Tokashiki Tsūkan 渡嘉敷通寛 (1794–1846/49), see below] saw this method in Satsuma and studied it. When Tokashiki returned after his studies, all people were ordered to use this smallpox vaccination method. 且聞日本去年用種痘之法，小児皆侍無恙。客歲，幸逢呂氏渡嘉敷親雲上通起前抵薩州之便，使之學習其法。今般因該通起習來，着令世人皆用種痘之法","Event_Source_Quoted_Text":null,"Event_Source_Remark":null,"Event_Source_lookup":"Tei, Kyūyō, 1745","Source_vol_p":"Appendix 5
